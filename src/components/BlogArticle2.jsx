              There are many online dating sites that singles have used but
              couldn't find a compatible partner. Perhaps you have tried some of
              these online dating sites as well but could not find a match; the
              reason for that is not far-fetched.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-2">
              The reason many cannot find a compatible partner on online dating
              apps is because of the lack of high-quality compatibility features
              offered on online sites and apps.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">

              quality features provided. Using the Baddhia Matchmaking app, you

              To have a good dating experience on the Baddhia App and to find a
              match, you need to define your preferences. Checking our
              compatibility features, you'll understand that having a good
              preference setup is essential for having a good match and a
              successful compatible relationship.

              1. <span className="font-semibold">Purpose Setting:</span> Before
              finding a compatible partner, there must be a mutual purpose; that
              is, your purpose and the purpose of your desired match must be
              mutual. So, you are required to set the kind of purpose you want
