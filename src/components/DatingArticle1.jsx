            <li>
              <span className='font-semibold'> 1. Multiple Profile Sheer: </span>Having a large number of profiles of potential matches can be overwhelming, making it hard to focus on just one person.

            <li>
              <span className='font-semibold'> 2. Lack of Depth in Interactions: </span>This lack of depth in communication and conversation often leads to an inauthentic connection with a potential match.

            <li className='mb-2'>
              <span className='font-semibold'>3. The Issue of Ghosting: </span>Users sometimes stop responding to chats and abort mutual plans, which can be disappointing.

            </li>
            <li>
              <span className='font-semibold'> 5. Mismatched Expectations: </span>Because people have different intentions and expectations for what they're looking for in dating apps, this can lead to disappointment on the other user's end.

            <li className='mb-2'>
