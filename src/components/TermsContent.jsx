        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-500 mb-5 leading-7">
          Except where prohibited by applicable law: The exclusive means of
          resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this
          Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), or the Service,
          regardless of the date of accrual shall be BINDING ARBITRATION
          administered by Lagos Court of Arbitration (LCA) except as modified by
          our Arbitration Procedures. The one exception to the exclusivity of
          arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an individual
          claim against the other in a small claims court of competent
          jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party may
          request that the dispute proceed in small claims court instead if the
          claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims court. If the
          request to proceed in small claims court is made before an arbitrator
          has been appointed, the arbitration shall be administratively closed.
          If the request to proceed in small claims court is made after an
          arbitrator has been appointed, the arbitrator shall determine whether
          the dispute should remain in arbitration or instead be decided in
          small claims court. Such arbitration shall be conducted by written
          submissions only, unless either you or Baddhia elect to invoke the
          right to an oral hearing before the Arbitrator. But whether you choose
          arbitration or small claims court, you agree that you will not under
          any circumstances commence, maintain, or participate in any class
          action, class arbitration, or other representative action or
          proceeding against Baddhia.

        <p className="text-gray-500 mb-5 leading-7">
          By accepting this Agreement, you agree to the Arbitration Agreement in
          this Section 15. In doing so, BOTH YOU AND BADDHIA GIVE UP THE RIGHT
          TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and Baddhia
          (except for matters that may be properly taken to a small claims court
          and are within such court’s jurisdiction). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT
          TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-500 mb-5 leading-7">
          If you assert a claim against Baddhia outside of small claims court
          (and Baddhia does not request that the claim, be moved to small claims
          court), your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A
          JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all claims and all
          issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. The same is true
          for Baddhia. Both you and Baddhia are entitled to a fair hearing
          before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can generally grant the relief
          that a court can, including the ability to hear a dispositive motion
          (which may include a dispositive motion based upon the parties’
          pleadings, as well as a dispositive motion based upon the parties’
          pleadings along with the evidence submitted), but you should note that
          arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than
          trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are
          enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very
          limited reasons.

        <p className="leading-7 text-gray-500 mb-6">
          The Jurisdiction and Venue provisions in Sections 16 and 17 are
          incorporated and are applicable to this Arbitration Agreement.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 mb-6 text-gray-500">
          As you decide whether to agree to this Arbitration Agreement, here are
          some important considerations:
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-500 mb-5 leading-7">
          Arbitration is a process of private dispute resolution that does not
          involve the civil courts, a civil judge, or a jury. Instead, the
          parties’ dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the
          parties under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (Chapter 18, Laws
          of the Federation of Nigeria 2004). Arbitration does not limit or
          affect the legal claims you as an individual may bring against
          Baddhia. Agreeing to arbitration will only affect where those claims
          may be brought and how they will be resolved.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 mb-6 text-gray-500">
          Arbitration is generally considered to be a more rapid dispute
          resolution process than the judicial system, but that is not always
          the case. The Arbitrator will typically determine whether Baddhia or
          you will be required to pay or split the cost of any arbitration with
          Baddhia, based on the circumstances presented.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 mb-6 text-gray-500">
          You will be precluded from bringing any class or representative action
          against Baddhia, and you will also be precluded from participating in
          any recovery resulting from any class or representative action brought
          against Baddhia.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-7 mb-10 text-gray-500">
          Whether to agree to this arbitration agreement is an important
          decision. It is your decision to make, and you should take care to
          conduct further research and to consult with others — including but
          not limited to an attorney — regarding the consequences of your
          decision, just as you would when making any other important business
          or life decision.
